# Grails React Profile
A profile for creating Grails applications with a React frontend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grails-profiles/react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grails-profiles/react)

```
grails create-app myApp --profile=react
```

 - If you are looking for the webpack/monolithic version of this profile, please see the 1.x branch: https://github.com/grails-profiles/react/tree/1.x You can install it with the command below:
 
 ```
grails create-app myApp --profile=org.grails.profiles:react:1.0.2
```

##Using the profile

This profile provides a client/server multi-project build. The server Grails app is using the rest-api profile with CORS enabled. It can be started using 'grails run-app' or using the Gradle wrapper:

      ./gradlew server:bootRun

The React client app has been built using the create-react-app CLI. It can be started via `npm start` (in which case you will need to run `npm install` to install npm dependencies) or using the Gradle wrapper (which will install npm dependencies automatically if needed):

      ./gradlew client:start

The client app's build.gradle defines other tasks to test and build the app using react-scripts. Please see create-react-app's documentation for more information: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

To run both client & server projects in parallel, use the Gradle wrapper:

     ./gradlew bootRun -parallel
