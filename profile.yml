description: A profile for creating Grails applications with a React frontend
instructions: |
    This profile provides a client/server multi-project build. The server Grails app is using the rest-api profile with CORS enabled. It can be started using 'grails run-app' or using the Gradle wrapper:

      ./gradlew server:bootRun

    The React client app has been built using the create-react-app CLI. It can be started via 'npm start' or using the Gradle wrapper:

      ./gradlew client:start

    The client app's build.gradle defines other tasks to test and build the app using react-scripts. Please see create-react-app's documentation for more information: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

    For support, please use the Groovy Community Slack (https://groovycommunity.slack.com/) or open an issue on Github: https://github.com/grails-profiles/react/issues
