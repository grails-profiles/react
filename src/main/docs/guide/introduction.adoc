Grails Profiles encapsulate project commands, templates, and plugins.
To create an application using the `react` profile you can use the next command:

`grails create-app myapp --profile=react`

This profile provides a client/server multi-project build structure.
The server Grails app is using the rest-api profile with CORS enabled.
It can be started using `grails run-app` or using the Gradle wrapper:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew server:bootRun
----
The React client app has been built using the create-react-app CLI. It can be started
via 'npm start' (in which case you will need to run 'npm install' to install npm dependencies) or using the
Gradle wrapper (which will install npm dependencies automatically if needed):

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew client:bootRun
----

The client app's build.gradle defines other tasks to test and build the app using react-scripts. Please see create-react-app's documentation for more information: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

To run both client & server projects in parallel, use the Gradle wrapper:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun -parallel
----

For support, please use the https://groovycommunity.slack.com/[Groovy Community Slack] or open an issue on
https://github.com/grails-profiles/react/issues[Github]

Also, you could create a Grails application using the `react` profile with the http://start.grails.org[Grails Application Forge]

Grails Application Forge is a great way to discover the different provided features in the profile.
